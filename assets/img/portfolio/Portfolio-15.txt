[Intro (00:00.00 - 00.30.0)]

(Instrumental)

[Verse (00:30.00 - 01:12.00)]
All these liars do be hittin social media these days
False information making friends go out their separate ways
I see them all just fight without a cause, only just to haze
Each other with their words on twitter, yeah they set it ablaze

Social Media platforms are becoming a warzone lately
And they all really be talkin bout their "President"s greatly
Then we students stand against them, and they say that we crazy
Educated a**es witnessing your dumba**es daily.

Relevancy is the thing that everyone cares about
Media influencers doing everything to chase clout
Our future's definitley gonna be heading the wrong route
'Cause MIL is something that everyone can't live without 

The world is full of childish people hidin behind a mask
knowing that in reality yeah they ain't up to the task
Because they know that if they fight they might end up in a cask-et
But on the internet they're starting wars, "But why tho?" I ask it

[Chorus 01:12.00 - 01:33.00]
Okay boomers, Nice to meet'cha 
The World has Changed so let me show ya
Your place
in line
Cause we decline
To follow your old style of thinking, Oh yeah we're fine.

Your information's so old school
Edited so much, man, It aint cool so just
STOP
AND DROP
YOUR INFO IS SLOP
Don't ever tell us how to run our shop.
